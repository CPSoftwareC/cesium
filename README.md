### INSTALLING ###

In order to transfer Cesium to your calculator, you must have a linking program, such as TI-Connect CE:
https://education.ti.com/en/us/products/computer_software/connectivity-software/ti-connect-ce-software/tabs/overview

Once installed, press the [Actions] tab on the main screen and select [Add files from Computer...]
From there, select the two programs, Cesium.8xp and A.8xp.
Press the [Send] button in the window that pops up.
Congradulations, Cesium is now on your calculator!

### RUNNING ###
All you need to do to run Cesium is to press [PGRM],[ENTER],[ENTER] in order to load prgmA.
If you are still unsure of what to do, simply press the [PGRM] button, select the option that says 1:A, and press enter.

The first time Cesium is run, it needs to copy some files to the archive to help with stability.
Once you get a "Cesium Installed" message, simply press [ENTER] again.
Now Cesium can be run at any time by running the prgmA.

one of the keys with a green letter above it, and it will take you to the first program with that
starts with that letter.

### RUNNING PROGRAMS ###
Cesium can run programs written in ASM, C, or BASIC, either from the archive or not. It is prefered
that you place programs in the archive, as it will protect them against RAM clears. To run a program,
simply press [2ND]. After a program is finished running, it  will return to Cesium.

### RESTORING ###
To protect against the case of a RAM clear, Cesium archives itself. To unarchive it,press
[2ND],[+],[2],[7], and make sure there isn't an astriek next to CESIUM. To reload, simply
go to the program menu and run with the Asm( command, findable in the catalog with [2ND],[0]
The homescreen should look like this:
Asm(prgmCESIUM
Press enter. Now, Cesium recreated prgmA for you, so use that on your next load.

appropriate one.
